AppArmor
========

AppArmor (Application Armor) is a Linux Security Module (LSM). It protects
the operating system by applying profiles to individual applications
or containers. In contrast to managing capabilities with `CAP_DROP `
and syscalls with seccomp, AppArmor allows for much finer-grained control.
